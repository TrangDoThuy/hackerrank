## Array Manipulation

Starting with a 1-indexed array of zeros and a list of operations, for each operation add a value to each of the array element between two given indices, inclusive. Once all operations have been performed, return the maximum value in the array.

## Ransom Note

Harold is a kidnapper who wrote a ransom note, but now he is worried it will be traced back to him through his handwriting. He found a magazine and wants to know if he can cut out whole words from it and use them to create an untraceable replica of his ransom note. The words in his note are case-sensitive and he must use only whole words available in the magazine. He cannot use substrings or concatenation to create the words he needs.

Given the words in the magazine and the words in the ransom note, print Yes if he can replicate his ransom note exactly using whole words from the magazine; otherwise, print No.

For example, the note is "Attack at dawn". The magazine contains only "attack at dawn". The magazine has all the right words, but there's a case mismatch. The answer is .

Function Description

Complete the checkMagazine function in the editor below. It must print  if the note can be formed using the magazine, or .

checkMagazine has the following parameters:

magazine: an array of strings, each a word in the magazine
note: an array of strings, each a word in the ransom note

## Sherlock and Anagrams
Two strings are anagrams of each other if the letters of one string can be rearranged to form the other string. Given a string, find the number of pairs of substrings of the string that are anagrams of each other.

For example , the list of all anagrammatic pairs is  at positions  respectively.

Function Description

Complete the function sherlockAndAnagrams in the editor below. It must return an integer that represents the number of anagrammatic pairs of substrings in .

sherlockAndAnagrams has the following parameter(s):

s: a string .
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries.
Each of the next  lines contains a string  to analyze.

## Count Triplets:
You are given an array and you need to find number of tripets of indices (i,j,k)  such that the elements at those indices are in geometric progression for a given common ratio r and i<j<k .

For example, arr=[1,4,16,64]. If r = 4, we have [1,4,6] and [4,16,64] at indices (0,1,2) and (1,2,3).

Function Description

Complete the countTriplets function in the editor below. It should return the number of triplets forming a geometric progression for a given r as an integer.

countTriplets has the following parameter(s):

arr: an array of integers
r: an integer, the common ratio

## Frequency Queries

### Function Description

Complete the freqQuery function in the editor below. It must return an array of integers where each element is a 1 if there is at least one element value with the queried number of occurrences in the current array, or 0 if there is not.

freqQuery has the following parameter(s):

queries: a 2-d array of integers
### Input Format

The first line contains of an integer *q*, the number of queries.
Each of the next *q* lines contains two integers denoting the 2-d array *queries.
